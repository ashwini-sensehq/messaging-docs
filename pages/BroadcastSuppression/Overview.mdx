# Overview

## Need for Broadcast Suppression

1. Broadcasts are one of the more dangerous features at Sense because they are likely to get carrier filtered. 
2. One of the best ways to improve deliverability and avoid being filtered is to make sure the audience of a broadcast is better targeted and that recipients are not being inundated with redundant communication.


## Settings

1. How to enable Broadcast Suppression

    1. Check if Brodacast Suppression flag is enabled for the agency from admin page[https://admin-me.sensehq.com/admin/product-flags/release-flags]

    3. Broadcast Suppression 
        1. Type
            1. Off (default and there will not be any suppression)
            2. Forced / Admin Controlled (numbers that have already received a message within the selected interval are automatically removed from the broadcast. )
            3. Optional / Recruiter Controlled (detected numbers are excluded from receiving the broadcast, but agents are given an option to add them back or to change the audience from agency wide to single phone number.)
        2. Time
            - Recruiters can edit the default time frame. Whatever they select is preserved and applied to the next time they compose a broadcast message.Recruiters can edit the default time frame. Whatever they select is preserved and applied to the next time they compose a broadcast message.
